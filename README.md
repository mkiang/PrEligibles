# PrEligibles -- Prevalence of US Singles
Code for a simple shiny app that takes ACS 2013 (1%) data (accessed via IPUMS) and calculates the prevalence of US residents who meet selected criteria. 

A working version is here: http://mkiang.shinyapps.io/PrEligibles

Note that the code is *very* rough shape. This was made relatively quickly as a (half) joke to one of my single friends. The code for the plot is entirely James Keirstead's and you can read about it here: http://www.jameskeirstead.ca/blog/waterfall-plots-in-r/
